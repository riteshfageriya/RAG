[Music] Hello, to make a good video, we need a good team.
With the help of a good team, the video can be made even better.
Usually, to make a short video, there are three to four people in the team who do the work of selecting and directing the camera, script, mic, shooting location.
The team making the video works like a cricket or football team, just like in a game, all the players follow the instructions of their captain and work to make the team win.
In the same way, all the members of the video making team also follow the orders of a captain to make a better video, whom we call the director.
In today's video series, we will talk about the head of the video making team, the director, and will know what are their main roles during the process of making a video.
After the closeup, we take a long shot.
It will feel good.
No, no, I think that after the closeup shot, we take a closeup shot of the other person as well.
What will happen with this, there will be no jerk or any shock and then after that we will take a long shot.
Absolutely right.
If you want, you can take OTS.
And yes, the dialogue is also a little long, so we can shorten it a little.
And also I will explain it in detail so that people can understand it easily, right? Making a video starts with scripting.
In this part, the director sits with his team and writes the script and discusses its basics like how the dialogues of the script should be short and funny, and easy so that people can understand, the expressions of the character should be according to the script and according to the place where the video is to be shown, apart from this, the things shown or told in the video should be technically correct.
After scripting, everyone together makes a story board in which it is clearly written that which shot is to be taken on which dialogue, what will be its angle, what will be shown in which scene, all this is decided.
Apart from this, in this stage, the director divides the work among his team like who will do the camera, who will be responsible for the script and sound and who will handle the location, during this time the director's decision is final, so look, I will take care of the script and direction and Geeta, you take care of the sound and camera, Raju you have to handle the background management, okay, take care that there is no noise from behind, okay, okay, apart from this, reflectors and I will also take care of the diffuser, that's fine.
Yes, I will take care of the camera's sound.
Yes, everyone has talked about the team.
So in this video, you saw how a director, along with his team, plays an important role in the selection of scripts and shorts.
In the next part, we will learn how a director selects a good character and shooting location.
Thank you
